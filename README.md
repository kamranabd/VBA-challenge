# VBA HW #2 - Due May 16th

# KAMRAN ABDULLAH

# Files contain:
#   3 screenshots for years 2014-2016 reults on Multi Year Stock Data
#   3 Different VBA Files
#       The first file is "VBAhw2_inital_instructions". This file contains the code written that is required by the inital instructions(ticker symbol, total stock volume, etc)
#       The second is "VBAhw2_challenge_1". the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume"
#       The third is "VBAhw2_challenge_2_final". This allows it to run on every worksheet. This contains all the script from the previous 2 VBA files and is the final version of this assignment.

# NOTE:I was unsure if I was required to add all of these VBA files, but the insturcitons stated to incukude "VBA Scripts as separate files" so I included them all seperately, however challenge_2 is the final version of this assignment.
